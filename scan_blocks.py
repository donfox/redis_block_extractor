# scan_blocks_dir.py
#
#	Scans a local directory containing downloaded blockchain block files to detect gaps in the 
#   sequence. The names of the missing files a stored in a list as the process continues.  
#
#   When the list is complete it is passed to a function that does an HTTP request for each file 
#   sequentially and writes the retrieved file to the local diretory containing the blocks.
#
#	Files found missing, are recorded to log and the file in each successful request is logged as 
#   is the record of it being written to the directory.
